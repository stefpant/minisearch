5 The blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions
6 A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority:
7 the maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of communicating
8 nodes running bitcoin software Transactions of the form payer X sends
9 Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available
10 software applications Network nodes can validate transactions add them
11 to their copy of the ledger and then broadcast these ledger additions to
12 other nodes The blockchain is a distributed database â€“ to achieve
13 independent verification of the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin
14 amount each network node stores its own copy of the
15 blockchain Approximately six times per hour a new group of accepted
16 transactions a block is created added to the blockchain and quickly
17 published to all nodes This allows bitcoin software to determine when a
18 particular bitcoin amount has been spent which is necessary in order to
19 prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight Whereas a
20 conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes
21 that exist apart from it the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can
22 be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions 5
23 Transactions
24 Number of bitcoin transactions per month (logarithmic scale)
25 See also: Bitcoin network
26 Transactions are defined using a Forth-like scripting language 5
27 Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs When a
28 user sends bitcoins the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin
29 being sent to that address in an output To prevent double spending each input
30 must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain The use of
31 multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash
32 transaction Since transactions can have multiple outputs users can send
33 bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction As in a cash transaction
34 the sum of inputs (coins used to pay)
35 can exceed the intended sum of payments In such a case an additional output
36 is used returning the change back to the payer Any input satoshis
37 not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee
38 Transaction fees
39 An actual bitcoin transaction including the fee from a webbased cryptocurrency
40 exchange to a hardware wallet
41 Paying a transaction fee is optional Miners can choose which transactions
42 to process and they are incentivised to prioritize those that pay
43 higher fees
44 Because the size of mined blocks is capped by the network miners choose
45 transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size not
46 the absolute amount of money paid as a fee Thus fees are generally measured
47 in satoshis per byte or sat/b The size of transactions is dependent on
48 the number of inputs used to create the transaction and the number of
49 outputs 8
50 Ownership
51 Simplified chain of ownership In reality a transaction can have more than
52 one input and more than one output
53 In the blockchain bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses Creating
54 a bitcoin address is nothing more than picking a random valid private key
55 and computing the corresponding bitcoin address This computation can be
56 done in a split second But the reverse (computing the private key of a
57 given bitcoin address) is mathematically unfeasible and so users can tell
58 others and make public a bitcoin address without compromising its
59 corresponding private key Moreover the number of valid private keys is so
60 vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is
61 already in use and has funds The vast number of valid private keys makes it
62 unfeasible that brute force could be used for that To be able
63 to spend the bitcoins the owner must know the corresponding private key and
64 digitally sign the transaction The network verifies the signature using the
65 public key 5
66 If the private key is lost the bitcoin network will not recognize any other
67 evidence of ownership the coins are then unusable and effectively lost
68 For example in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7500 bitcoins worth $75
69 million at the time when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing
70 his private key A backup of his key(s)
